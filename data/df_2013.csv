The problem is that I don't speak Russian/Ukrainian at all (I don't even read Cyrillic) and I can't seem to find train prices for this track.

So I created it a couple of days ago, and now only have like 20 people only(( working on it. So I did a stupid thing, really stupid thing, I dont know why, I thought it would be ok - I have wrote a message to admin of 9gag public page on vk, asking him, can he just post a link for my new page at his page as a new post just for people to check this out, and to follow it as well. So he replied - 'This is gonna cost you 300 rbls for one post, and is gonna be going down every hour after every new post.' So, I answered 'No thanks, man, I probably look at things differently'. He said ""Well we are competitors, so NO""/ Here is the screenshot of our chat, if somebody understands Russian: http://imgur.com/BqQTI I need your opinion Reddit.

I'm an American touring in the Ukraine for a while as part of a longer extended trip. I'm I'm Kiev right now. One of our stops down the line is Liberia in western Africa and I need a yellow fever vaccination to get a visa to go there.

In the Ukraine it appears that these vaccines are only available at the regional hospital (in fact it seems they may only be available in Kiev, not in other cities), and that they are dispensed in pairs only as one vial of vaccine contains two doses and an extra dose can not be discarded.

I am in Kiev through Saturday ideally so I would like to get the vaccine tomorrow. The hospital is trying to find another vaccine seeker to pair me up with but I thought I'd ask here if anyone for some reason needed or wanted to get vaccinated.

In order to receive the vaccine you need to get a certification from your doctor that you are in good health - I don't know what that entails for locals. For me I went to a fancy English speaking clinic where the dr charged me an arm and a leg to ask me 10 questions and fill out a form; it probably only makes sense if your doctor could just email or fax something to you based on a recent checkup.

The vaccine itself has relatively mild side effects - a very small number of people have allergic reactions and a slightly larger group get a fever or feel ill for a day as it's a live virus. Many people get a sore shoulder.

Once you are vaccinated you are protected for approximately 10 years.

This seems like a very long shot but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask just in case anyone on this forum happens to know they are traveling to affected regions over the next while and will need the shot eventually.

I would be willing to pay some amount of reasonable expenses incurred including the cost of the vaccine itself (which as i undetstand it is quite cheap) plus charges to get the preauthorization from your doctor so long as those charges are meaningfully lower than the fleecing I received at the fancy English clinic.",hello american touring ukraine longer extended trip kiev right stops line liberia western africa need yellow fever vaccination visa ukraine appears vaccines available regional hospital fact available kiev cities dispensed pairs vial vaccine contains doses extra dose discarded kiev saturday ideally like vaccine tomorrow hospital trying find vaccine seeker pair thought ask reason needed wanted vaccinated order receive vaccine need certification doctor good health know entails locals went fancy english_speaking clinic dr charged arm leg ask questions fill form probably makes_sense doctor email fax based recent checkup vaccine relatively mild effects small number people allergic reactions slightly larger group fever feel ill day live virus people sore shoulder vaccinated protected approximately years like long shot figured hurt ask case forum happens know traveling affected regions need shot eventually willing pay reasonable expenses incurred including cost vaccine undetstand cheap plus charges preauthorization doctor long charges meaningfully lower fleecing received fancy english clinic,5,,2010,4,,

I'm an American who's just returned from a three-week visit to your country. It was . . . pretty wonderful. I can't possibly cram all three weeks' worth of my impressions and experiences into this, because I want to keep it short. But it really was wonderful. I'd get on a plane and go back tonight if I could.

I was privileged to talk to a handful of natives, and I've been thinking quite a bit about the things they said about living there.

In L'viv, I met a man in his 50s who was born in L'viv, left with his family for America when the KGB forced them out of their flat, has been living in Chicago for the past 30 years, and is planning to return to L'viv for good when he retires. He cited the American tax system and housing costs as two reasons for wanting to return, and said that he'll be able to live like a king there on his pension. (Which I believe, considering that a big bottle of Lvivske White--excuse my spelling--costs about US $0.76.)

By contrast, the coolest eight people in Kyiv under the age of 20 all seemed either ambivalent or downright negative about living in Ukraine. Several of them mentioned a desire to leave as soon as they finish university.

So I'm curious, r/Ukraine. How do *you* feel about living there? What do you like and/or dislike about it? Would you leave if you got the chance, or do you want to stay there forever?

This is not in any way relevant to my question, but I have to say it: The things you people do with meat . . . my god.

I've got two questions about tramway in Kiev

1. No more than month ago in each tram I rode there was conductor who sold tickets. Now they are gone. Is that always happening this time of a year or they decided they are not needed anymore? 

2. I always start my ride on this old tram stop where are no ticket validators, so I validate it in tram using this device that makes wholes in ticket. However on new tram stops you need to validate ticket while passing the gate - and it prints date and time on the ticket. Do I still have to punch it in tramway? I've seen that sometimes people do that, but most don't.

3. Does anybody controls ticket in trams? Because even when there were conductors they just always asked if I had a ticket with intention to sell it to me if I don't, not to check it. Maybe once someone really asked me to show the ticket.

I've tried looking up the exact address on GoogleMaps and I couldn't find it. It seems as though street addresses in Ukraine may be structured differently than in Canada/US, making my search more difficult to confirm.  Any help would be sincerely appreciated! Thanks :)

67276968,t3_141z8o,1354290038,2012-11-30 15:40:38,0,cyborg_selkie,Question about expat salary vs. cost of living in Kyiv. ,"Hi again! I was here a while ago asking about language in Ukraine, and I'm back with another question. 

My husband and I are international school teachers, currently based in China. We were recently interviewed for a job working in an International school in Kyiv. The school quoted that their top salary for teachers is 33k USD before tax. I'm just getting my teaching qualification, so my income should go up wherever I land next year. My husband is currently making ~46 USD after tax, so even if he falls into the top salary bracket he'd be taking a significant pay cut if we moved out here. If I was making, say 25K and he was making 30K, our combined income in Kyiv would be slightly less than it is with me working as an unqualified teacher in China.  

So how far does this salary go in Kyiv? Is the cost of living really that cheap, or are salaries (even for expats) particularly low? 

Edit: Housing is free (one-bedroom apartment provided by the school - don't know how nice it is though). The headmaster said $5,000 of the salary is taxed at 15%, the rest is tax free (which I guess is a way of professionally dodging taxes). We'd also be living in the suburbs (near the school) so I'm guessing shops and restaurants would be cheaper there than in the city center. They also pay for round-trip flights to the uk and healthcare.

I am an American traveling with a Ukrainian who I lived with in the US. We arrived in Ukraine on July 31st, via a train from Hungary, and toured around the country for a while visiting all the different regions. 

Afterwards we visited my friends' family in Dnipropetrovsk and had planned to leave to go to Russia by the end of October (when my 90 days would expire). Unfortunately my travel mate hurt his foot badly the week before we were supposed to leave, after a couple weeks he realized it wasn't healing and went to the doctor here and found out it was broken and that he needed some surgery. So, as it stands now they expect him to be able to walk again by the end of December or so (he has another xray appointment for this week to confirm that). 

I contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but they said that a visa extension could only be issued for me if it was my foot that was broken, they didn't give a shit that my travelmate/translator was injured. So I am technically a month over my limit and it will be another month before we will be able to leave. I was thinking about heading to Munich on my own so I could spend Christmas with a friend who lives there while my travel-mate's foot heals.

I did some research online and it seems that I may have to bribe someone in order to leave, I don't really feel comfortable doing that and without my Ukrainian friend to help me I am a bit concerned about crossing the border. I am just wondering if anyone knows of a better way for me to get out of the country without any issues.
